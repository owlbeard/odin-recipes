    <h1><span>Fried Rice</h1></span>
    <img src="../images/fried-rice.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This is one of the recipes I had learned from the talented Japanese Chefs who work
        in the one of the most high-end fine dining restaurants in Okinawa back in 2018 (namely, Chef Abe
        in Ryukyu no Ushi restaurant :)). This recipe is one of the easiest and tastiest Japanese recipes
        you can make at your home, so definitely try it out! If you have plain 
        cooked rice from the other day it's even better because this recipe is built 
        for salvaging leftover cooked rice into something really delicious.
    </p>
    <h2><span>Ingredients</h2></span>
    <div class="list"><ul>
        <li>200 ml rice of your choice</li>
        <li>1 <small>onion</small></li>
        <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>5 tbsp salt-reduced soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>scallions(green part) for garnish</li>
        </ul></div>
    <h2><span>Preparation</h2></span>
    <p>If you have leftover plain cooked rice at your disposal, you can skip to step 5.</p>
    <div class="list2"><ol>
        <li>Wash the rice, put them into a pan (with a lid) and roast them for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add water equals to double the amount of rice we are using (in this case 400mls of water). </li>
        <li>Let it boil at high heat and once it has reached boiling state put it down to low heat
            and let it cook with lid on, undisturbed for 14 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the rice is cooked, transfer it into a large plate and spread it to let it cool down.
            When it's cooled down put it in a refrigerator for 2-3 hours so it can dry out.</li>
        <li>Dice onion and garlic cloves, put some cooking oil in a pan and caramelize the onions.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the pan and let them socialize with the onions for one minute.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice in the pan and mix it well with the onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Pour down 5 tbsp of soy sauce in the pan and mix it again.</li>
        <li>Push the rice aside, crack two eggs on the empty side of the pan and scramble them.
            Don't stop scrambling so your eggs won't get burnt or get stuck on the pan.</li>
        <li>After the eggs are nicely cooked mix them with the rice.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste and mix them with the rice thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Garnish the dish with the finely chopped scallions and mix it with the rice
            and cook it for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Dig in!</li>
        </ol></div>
